    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Egg pudding is a yummy treat that's smooth and creamy! It's made with eggs, milk, and sugar, and sometimes has a yummy vanilla flavor. Some egg puddings are baked in the oven, while others are cooked in a pot on the stove top.</p>
    
    <p> It's perfect for a sweet snack or a light dessert, and you can eat it warm or cold.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask an adult to help you with the stove and sharp tools.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, milk, vanilla extract, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into four ramekins or custard cups.</li>
        <li>Place the ramekins in a baking dish and carefully pour hot water into the baking dish to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. This is called a water bath.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the pudding is set but still slightly jiggly in the center.</li>
        <li>Remove the ramekins from the water bath and let them cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
